QUESTION: list the steps of extracting copper


PASSAGE: the cylinder and are used to introduce air into the  converter. Lime and silica are added to the copper matte to react with the iron oxide produced in  the process to form slag. Scrap copper may also be added to the converter. The furnace is rotated  so that the tuyres are submerged, and air is blown into the molten matte causing the remainder of  the iron sulphide to react with oxygen to form iron oxide and sulphur dioxide. Then the converter  is rotated to pour off the iron silicate slag.   NEW PAGE  Once all of the iron is removed, the converter is rotated back and given a second blow of air during  which the remainder of the sulphur is oxidized and removed from the copper sulphide. The  converter is then rotated to pour off the molten copper, which at this point is called blister copper  (so named because if allowed to solidify at this point, it will have a bumpy surface due to the  presence of gaseous oxygen and sulphur). Sulphur dioxide from the converters is collected and fed  into the gas purification system together with that from the smelting furnace and made into  sulphuric acid. Due to its residual copper content, slag is recycled back to the smelting furnace.  Blister copper, containing a minimum of 98.5% copper, is refined to high purity copper in two  steps. The first step is fire refining, in which the molten blister copper is poured into a cylindrical  furnace, similar in appearance to a converter, where first air and then natural gas or propane are  blown through the melt to remove the last of the sulphur and any residual oxygen from the copper.  The  molten  copper  is  then  poured  into  a  casting  wheel  to  form  anodes  pure  enough  for  electrorefining.  In electrorefining, the copper anodes are loaded into electrolytic cells and interspaced with copper  starting sheets, or cathodes, in a bath of copper sulphate solution. When a direct current is passed  through the cell the copper is dissolved from the anode, transported through the electrolyte and re- deposited on the cathode starting sheets. When the cathodes have built-up to sufficient thickness  they are removed from the electrolytic cell and a new set of starting sheets is put in their place.  Solid impurities in the anodes fall to the bottom of the cell as a sludge where they are ultimately  collected and processed for the recovery of precious metals such as gold and silver. This material  is known as anode slime.  The cathodes removed from the electrolytic cell are the

RESPONSE:

1. Copper matte is placed in a converter. 2. Lime and silica are added to the converter. 3. The furnace is rotated so that the tuyres are submerged. 4. Air is blown into the molten matte, causing the iron sulphide to react with oxygen and form iron oxide and sulphur dioxide. 5. The converter is rotated to pour off the iron silicate slag. 6. The converter is rotated back and given a second blow of air, during which the sulphur is oxidized and removed from the copper sulphide. 7. The converter is then rotated to pour off the molten copper, which at this point is called blister copper. 8.
