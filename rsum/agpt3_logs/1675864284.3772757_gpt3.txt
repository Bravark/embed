QUESTION: list the steps of extracting copper


PASSAGE: Precautions  include:  LEV  for  dusts  during  transfer  operations;  local  exhaust  and  dilution  ventilation for sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide; a noise control and hearing protection  programme; protective clothing and shields, rest breaks and fluids for heat stress; and LEV, PPE  and electrical precautions for electrolytic processes. Respiratory protection is commonly worn to  protect against dusts, fumes and sulphur dioxide. Table 1.

To begin, a feedstock comprising mainly  of lead concentrate in the form of lead sulphide is fed into a sintering machine. Other  raw materials may be added including iron, silica, limestone flux, coke, soda, ash,  pyrite, zinc, caustic and particulates gathered from pollution control devices. In the  sintering machine the lead feedstock is subjected to blasts of hot air which burn off  the sulphur, creating sulphur dioxide. The lead oxide material existing after this  process contains about 9% of its weight in carbon. The sinter is then fed along with  coke, various recycled and cleanup materials, limestone and other fluxing agents  into a blast furnace for reducing, where the carbon acts as a fuel and smelts or melts  the lead material.

RESPONSE:

1. Copper ore is mined and then transported to a copper smelter. 2. At the smelter, the ore is heated and mixed with other materials such as limestone, quartz, and silica. 3. This mixture is then melted and poured into a mold to create copper ingots. 4. The ingots are then transported to a copper refinery. 5. At the refinery, the ingots are melted and mixed with sulfuric acid. 6. This mixture is then passed through an electrolytic process to extract the copper. 7. The copper is then cast into molds to create Copper bars.
