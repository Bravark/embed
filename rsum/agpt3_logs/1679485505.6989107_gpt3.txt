QUESTION: what is smelting in pyrometalurgy?


PASSAGE: lead, iron sulphides, silica and other pollutants. Smelter management should include evaluation and control of emissions from the plant. This is  specialized work which should be carried out only by personnel thoroughly familiar with the  chemical properties and toxicities of the materials discharged from the plant processes. The  physical state of the material, the temperature at which it leaves the process, other materials in  the gas stream and other factors must all be considered when planning measures to control air  pollution. It is also desirable to maintain a weather station, to keep meteorological records and to  be prepared to reduce output when weather conditions are unfavourable for dispersal of stack  effluents. Field trips are necessary to observe the effect of air pollution on residential and  farming areas.  Sulphur dioxide, one of the major contaminants, is recovered as sulphuric acid when present in  sufficient quantity. Otherwise, to meet emission standards, sulphur dioxide and other hazardous  gaseous wastes are controlled by scrubbing. Particulate emissions are commonly controlled by  fabric filters and electrostatic precipitators.  Large amounts of water are used in flotation processes such as copper concentration. Most of this  water is recycled back into the process. Tailings from the flotation process are pumped as slurry  into sedimentation ponds. Water is recycled in the process. Metal-containing process water and  rainwater are cleaned in water-treatment plants before discharging or recycling.  Solid-phase wastes include slags from smelting, blowdown slurries from sulphur dioxide  conversion to sulphuric acid and sludges from surface impoundments (e.g., sedimentation  ponds). Some slags can be reconcentrated and returned to smelters for reprocessing or recovery  of other metals present. Many of these solid-phase wastes are hazardous wastes that must be  stored according to environmental regulations.  Copper Production Hazards and their prevention  The major hazards are exposure to ore dusts during ore processing and smelting, metal fumes  (including copper, lead and arsenic) during smelting, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide during  most smelting operations, noise from crushing and grinding operations and from furnaces, heat  stress from the furnaces and sulphuric acid and electrical hazards during electrolytic processes.  Precautions  include:  LEV  for  dusts  during  transfer  operations;  local  exhaust  and  dilution


DETAILED ANSWER:

RESPONSE:

Smelting is a process of heating and melting ore to extract the desired metal. In pyrometalurgy, smelting is used to extract metals from their ores using high temperatures. The process usually involves using a furnace to heat the ore to a high temperature, at which point the desired metal(s) can be extracted from it. The process can produce harmful pollutants such as lead, iron sulphides, silica and other pollutants, so smelter management should include evaluation and control of emissions from the plant.
