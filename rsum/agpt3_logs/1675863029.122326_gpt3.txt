RESPONSE:

The extraction of copper involves a number of steps, including smelting, fire refining, and electrorefining. Smelting is the first step in the process, and involves heating the copper ore in a furnace to remove impurities. The resulting copper matte is then treated with lime and silica to remove iron oxide, and any scrap copper is also added to the converter. The furnace is rotated so that the tuyres are submerged, and air is blown into the molten matte, causing the remainder of the iron sulphide to react with oxygen to form iron oxide and sulphur dioxide. The converter is then rotated to pour off the iron silicate slag. Once all of the iron is removed, the converter is rotated back and given a second blow of air during which the remainder of the sulphur is oxidized and removed from the copper sulphide. The converter is then rotated to pour off the molten copper, which at this point is called blister copper (so named because if allowed to solidify at this point, it will have a bumpy surface due to the presence of gaseous oxygen and sulphur).
