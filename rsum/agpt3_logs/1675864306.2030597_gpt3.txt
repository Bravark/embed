The following IS an extracted text for the Question: list the steps of extracting copper Write a concise summary in a way that answers the question:
 
1. The primary product of the copper producer is 99.99+% copper. 2. This copper is sold to wire-rod mills as cathodes or processed further to a product called rod. 3. In manufacturing rod, cathodes are melted in a shaft furnace and the molten copper is poured onto a casting wheel to form a bar suitable for rolling into a 3/8 inch diameter continuous rod. 4. This rod product is shipped to wire mills where it is extruded into various sizes of copper wire. 5. In the hydrometallurgical process, the oxidized ores and waste materials are leached with sulphuric acid from the smelting process. 6. Leaching is performed in situ, or in specially prepared piles by distributing acid across the top and allowing it to percolate down through the material where it is collected. 7. The ground under the leach pads is lined with an acid-proof, impermeable plastic material to prevent leach liquor from contaminating groundwater. 8. Once the copper-rich solutions are collected they can be processed by either of two processesthe cementation process or the solvent extraction/electrowinning process (SXEW). 9. In the cementation process (which is rarely used today), the copper in the acidic solution is deposited on the surface of scrap iron in exchange for the iron. 10. When sufficient copper has been cemented out, the copper-rich iron is put into the smelter together with the ore concentrates for copper recovery via the pyrometallurgical route. 11. In the SXEW process, the pregnant leach solution (PLS) is concentrated by solvent extraction, which extracts copper but not impurity metals (iron and other impurities). 12. The copper-laden organic solution is then separated from the leachate in a settling tank. 13. Sulphuric acid is added to the pregnant organic mixture, which strips the copper into an electrolytic solution. 14. The leachate, containing the iron and other impurities, is returned to the leaching operation where its acid is used for further leaching. 15. The copper-rich strip solution is passed into an electrolytic cell known as an electrowinning cell. 16. An electrowinning cell differs from an electrorefining cell in that it uses a permanent, insoluble anode. 17. The copper in solution is then plated onto a starting sheet cathode in much the same manner as it is on the cathode in an electrorefining cell. 18. The copper-depleted electrolyte is returned to the solvent extraction process where it is used to strip more copper from the organic solution.  1. Copper is mined in both open pits and underground mines, depending upon the ore grade and the nature of the ore deposit. 2. Copper ore typically contains less that 1% copper in the form of sulphide minerals. 3. Once the ore is delivered above the ground, it is crushed and ground to a powdery fineness and then concentrated for further processing. 4. In the concentration process, ground ore is slurried with water, chemical reagents are added, and air is blown through the slurry. The air bubbles attach themselves to the copper minerals and are then skimmed off the top of the flotation cells. 5. The concentrate contains between 20 and 30% copper. The tailings, or gangue minerals, from the ore fall to the bottom of the cells and are removed, dewatered by thickeners and transported as a slurry to a tailings pond for disposal. All water used in this operation, from dewatering thickeners and the tailings pond, is recovered and recycled back into the process. 6. Copper can be produced either pyrometallurgically or hydrometallurgically depending upon the ore-type used as a charge. The ore concentrates, which contain copper sulphide and iron sulphide minerals, are treated by pyrometallurgical processes to yield high purity copper products. Oxide ores, which contain copper oxide minerals that may occur in other parts of the mine, together with other oxidized waste materials, are treated by hydrometallurgical processes to yield high purity copper products. 7. Copper conversion from the ore to metal is
