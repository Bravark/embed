formantimony); matte  (copper sulphide and other metal sulphides); blast furnace slag (primarily silicates);  and lead bullion (98% lead, by weight). All layers are then drained off. The speiss  and matte are sold to copper smelters for recovery of copper and precious metals.  The blast furnace slag which contains zinc, iron, silica and lime is stored in piles and  partially recycled. Sulphur oxide emissions are generated in blast furnaces from  small quantities of residual lead sulphide and lead sulphates in the sinter feed.  Rough lead bullion from the blast furnace usually requires preliminary treatment in  kettles  before  undergoing  refining  operations.  During  drossing,  the  bullion  is  agitated in a drossing kettle and cooled to just above its freezing point (370 to  425C). A dross, which is composed of lead oxide, along with copper, antimony and  other elements, floats to the top and solidifies above the molten lead.  The dross is removed and fed into a dross furnace for recovery of the non-lead useful  metals. To enhance copper recovery, drossed lead bullion is treated by adding  sulphur-bearing materials, zinc, and/or aluminium, lowering the copper content to  approximately 0.01%.  During the fourth step, the lead bullion is refined using pyrometallurgical methods  to remove any remaining non-lead saleable materials (e.g., gold, silver, bismuth,  zinc, and metal oxides such as antimony, arsenic, tin and copper oxide). The lead is  refined in a cast iron kettle by five stages. Antimony, tin and arsenic are removed  first. Then zinc is added and gold and silver are removed in the zinc slag. Next, the  lead is refined by vacuum removal (distillation) of zinc. Refining continues with the  addition of calcium and magnesium. These two materials combine with bismuth to  form an insoluble compound that is skimmed from the kettle. In the final step caustic  soda and/or nitrates may be added to the lead to remove any remaining traces of metal impurities. The refined lead will have a purity of 99.90 to 99.99% and may be  mixed with other metals to form alloys or it may be directly cast into shapes.                              Table 2.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The process of lead smelting and refining consists of four steps: sintering, drossing, refining, and casting. Lead ore, iron, silica, limestone, flux, coke, soda, ash, pyrite, and zinc are used as inputs in the sintering step. This step produces emissions of sulphur dioxide and particulate matter, as well as waste products containing cadmium and other metals. The drossing step uses a drossing kettle to remove a dross composed of lead oxide and other elements from the molten lead. The refining step uses pyrometallurgical methods to remove non-lead saleable materials from the lead bullion. Finally, the lead is cast into shapes.
