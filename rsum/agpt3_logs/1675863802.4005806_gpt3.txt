QUESTION: what is the exraction of copper


PASSAGE: production.  Copper  Copper is mined in both open pits and underground mines, depending upon the ore grade and the  nature of the ore deposit. Copper ore typically contains less that 1% copper in the form of sulphide  minerals. Once the ore is delivered above the ground, it is crushed and ground to a powdery  fineness and then concentrated for further processing. In the concentration process, ground ore is  slurried with water, chemical reagents are added, and air is blown through the slurry. The air  bubbles attach themselves to the copper minerals and are then skimmed off the top of the flotation  cells. The concentrate contains between 20 and 30% copper. The tailings, or gangue minerals, from  the ore fall to the bottom of the cells and are removed, dewatered by thickeners and transported as  a slurry to a tailings pond for disposal. All water used in this operation, from dewatering thickeners  and the tailings pond, is recovered and recycled back into the process.  Copper can be produced either pyrometallurgically or hydrometallurgically depending upon the  ore-type used as a charge. The ore concentrates, which contain copper sulphide and iron sulphide  minerals, are treated by pyrometallurgical processes to yield high purity copper products. Oxide  ores, which contain copper oxide minerals that may occur in other parts of the mine, together with  other oxidized waste materials, are treated by hydrometallurgical processes to yield high purity  copper products.  Copper conversion from the ore to metal is accomplished by smelting. During smelting the  concentrates are dried and fed into one of several different types of furnaces. There the sulphide   NEW PAGE  minerals are partially oxidized and melted to yield a layer of matte, a mixed copper-iron sulphide  and slag, an upper layer of waste.                                    The matte is further processed by converting. The slag is tapped from the furnace and stored or  discarded in slag piles onsite. A small amount of slag is sold for railroad ballast and for sand  blasting grit. A third product of the smelting process is sulphur dioxide, a gas which is collected,  purified and made into sulphuric acid for sale or for use in hydrometallurgical leaching operations.  Following smelting, the copper matte is fed into a converter. During this process the copper matte  is poured into a horizontal cylindrical vessel (approximately 104 m) fitted with a row of pipes.  The pipes, known as tuyres, project into

RESPONSE:

The process of extracting copper from ore is typically divided into two main steps: concentration and smelting. The first step, concentration, involves crushing the ore and separating out the copper-containing minerals using a process called flotation. The copper concentrates are then dried and fed into one of several different types of furnaces for smelting. During smelting, the concentrates are partially oxidized and melted to yield a layer of matte (a mixed copper-iron sulphide) and slag (an upper layer of waste). The matte is further processed by converting, while the slag is tapped from the furnace and stored or discarded. A small amount of slag is sometimes sold for railroad ballast or sand blasting grit. The second main step, smelting, yields a third product: sulphur dioxide, a gas which is collected, purified and made into sulphuric acid for sale or for use in hydrometallurgical leaching operations.
