Write a concise summary of the following:

The primary product of the copper producer is cathodes, which contain 99.99+% copper. These may be sold to wire-rod mills, or they may be processed further into a product called rod. In manufacturing rod, cathodes are melted in a shaft furnace and the molten copper is poured onto a casting wheel to form a bar suitable for rolling into a 3/8 inch diameter continuous rod. This rod product is shipped to wire mills where it is extruded into various sizes of copper wire. In the hydrometallurgical process, the oxidized ores and waste materials are leached with sulphuric acid from the smelting process. Leaching is performed in situ, or in specially prepared piles by distributing acid across the top and allowing it to percolate down through the material where it is collected. The ground under the leach pads is lined with an acid-proof, impermeable plastic material to prevent leach liquor from contaminating groundwater. Once the copper-rich solutions are collected they can be processed by either of two processesthe cementation process or the solvent extraction/electrowinning process (SXEW). In the cementation process (which is rarely used today), the copper in the acidic solution is deposited on the surface of scrap iron in exchange for the iron. When sufficient copper has been cemented out, the copper-rich iron is put into the smelter together with the ore concentrates for copper recovery via the pyrometallurgical route. In the SXEW process, the pregnant leach solution (PLS) is concentrated by solvent extraction, which extracts copper but not impurity metals (iron and other impurities). The copper-laden organic solution is then separated from the leachate in a settling tank. Sulphuric acid is added to the pregnant organic mixture, which strips the copper into an electrolytic solution. The leachate, containing the iron and other impurities, is returned to the leaching operation where its acid is used for further leaching. The copper-rich strip solution is passed into an electrolytic cell known as an electrowinning cell. An electrowinning cell differs from an electrorefining cell in that it uses a permanent, insoluble anode. The copper in solution is then plated onto a starting sheet cathode in much the same manner as it is on the cathode in an electrorefining cell. The copper-depleted electrolyte is returned to the solvent extraction process where it is used to strip more copper from the organic solution. The cathodes produced from the  The process of extracting copper from ore is typically divided into two main steps: concentration and smelting. The first step, concentration, involves crushing the ore and separating out the copper-containing minerals using a process called flotation. The copper concentrates are then dried and fed into one of several different types of furnaces for smelting. During smelting, the concentrates are partially oxidized and melted to yield a layer of matte (a mixed copper-iron sulphide) and slag (an upper layer of waste). The matte is further processed by converting, while the slag is tapped from the furnace and stored or discarded. A small amount of slag is sometimes sold for railroad ballast or sand blasting grit. The second main step, smelting, yields a third product: sulphur dioxide, a gas which is collected, purified and made into sulphuric acid for sale or for use in hydrometallurgical leaching operations.  Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores. The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors. In general, copper extraction follows the sequence (see Figure below): 1. Ore concentration by froth flotation. 2. Roasting and reverberatory furnace smelting of sulfide concentrates. 3. Conversion of matte to copper blister in a converter. 4. Fire refining of blister copper to 97-99% pure copper. 5.
