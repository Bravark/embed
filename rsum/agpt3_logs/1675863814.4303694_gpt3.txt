QUESTION: what is the exraction of copper


PASSAGE: many of the iron  impurities drop out of the solution as well as the zinc.  After leaching, the solution is purified in two or more stages by adding zinc dust. The solution is  purified as the dust forces deleterious elements to precipitate so that they can be filtered out.  Purification is usually conducted in large agitation tanks. The process takes place at temperatures  ranging from 40 to 85C and pressures ranging from atmospheric to 2.4 atmospheres. The elements  recovered during purification include copper as a cake and cadmium as a metal. After purification  the solution is ready for the final step, electrowinning.  Zinc electrowinning takes place in an electrolytic cell and involves running an electric current from  a lead-silver alloy anode through the aqueous zinc solution. This process charges the suspended  zinc and forces it to deposit onto an aluminium cathode which is immersed in the solution. Every  24 to 48 hours, each cell is shut down, the zinc-coated cathodes removed and rinsed, and the zinc   NEW PAGE  mechanically stripped from the aluminium plates. The zinc concentrate is then melted and cast into  ingots and is often as high as 99.995% pure.  Electrolytic zinc smelters contain as many as several hundred cells. A portion of the electrical  energy is converted into heat, which increases the temperature of the electrolyte. Electrolytic cells  operate at temperature ranges from 30 to 35C at atmospheric pressure. During electrowinning a  portion of the electrolyte passes through cooling towers to decrease its temperature and to  evaporate the water it collects during the process.                                    Hazards and their prevention  The major hazards are exposure to ore dusts during ore processing and smelting, metal fumes  (including zinc and lead) during refining and roasting, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide  during most smelting operations, noise from crushing and grinding operations and from furnaces,  heat  stress  from  the  furnaces  and  sulphuric  acid  and  electrical  hazards  during  electrolytic  processes.   NEW PAGE  Precautions  include:  LEV  for  dusts  during  transfer  operations;  local  exhaust  and  dilution  ventilation for sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide; a noise control and hearing protection  programme; protective clothing and shields, rest breaks and fluids for heat stress; and LEV, PPE,  and electrical precautions for electrolytic processes.

RESPONSE:

The process of extracting copper from ore is known as smelting. Copper is typically extracted from oxide and sulfide ores that contain between 0.5 and 2.0% copper. The first step in the smelting process is to concentrate the ore, which typically contains between 0.5 and 2.0% copper, into a more concentrated form. The ore is then roasted in a furnace to convert the sulfides into oxides, which are then smelted in a furnace to produce copper metal.
