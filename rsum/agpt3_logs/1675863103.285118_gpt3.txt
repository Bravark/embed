PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:

copper is then poured into a mold where it cools and solidifies. The impurities, which are mostly sulfur, are removed as slag. The next step in the process is known as pyrometallurgy, which involves heating the copper ore in a furnace to a temperature of around 1,000 degrees Celsius. This high temperature causes the sulfur impurities to combine with the oxygen in the air to form sulfur dioxide, which is then removed from the furnace. The final step in the process is known as electrolysis, which involves passing an electric current through the copper sulfate solution. This process causes the copper to be deposited onto the cathode, while the impurities are left behind in the solution.  The extraction of copper involves a series of physical and chemical reactions. The end-product is copper metal containing controlled amounts of impurities. The primary smelting and refining process produces copper metal directly from ore concentrates. The secondary smelting and refining process produces copper metal from scrap and process waste. The pyrometallurgical process uses heat to separate desired metals from other materials. This process uses differences between oxidation potentials, melting points, vapour pressures, densities and/or miscibility of the ore components when melted. The hydrometallurgical process differs from the pyrometallurgical process in that the desired metals are separated from other materials using techniques that capitalize on differences between constituent solubilities and/or electrochemical properties in aqueous solutions. During the pyrometallic processing, an ore is first beneficiated (concentrated by crushing, grinding, floating and drying). It is then sintered or roasted (calcined) with other materials such as baghouse dust and flux. The concentrate is then smelted, or melted, in a blast furnace in order to fuse the desired metals into an impure molten bullion. This bullion then undergoes a third pyrometallic process to refine the metal to the desired level of purity. Each time the ore or bullion is heated, waste materials are created. Dust from ventilation and process gases may be captured in a baghouse and are either disposed of or returned to the process, depending upon the residual metal content. Sulphur in the gas is also captured, and when concentrations are above 4% it can be turned into sulphuric acid. Depending upon the origin of the ore and its residual metals content, various metals such as gold and silver may also be produced as by-products. Roasting is an important pyrometallurgical process. Sulphating roasting is used in the production of cobalt and zinc. Its purpose is to separate the metals so that they can be transformed into a water-soluble form.
