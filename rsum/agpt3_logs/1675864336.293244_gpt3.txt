accomplished by smelting. During smelting the concentrates are dried and fed into one of several different types of furnaces. There the sulphide minerals are partially oxidized and melted to yield a layer of matte, a mixed copper-iron sulphide and slag, an upper layer of waste. 8. The matte is further processed by converting. The slag is tapped from the furnace and stored or discarded in slag piles onsite. A small amount of slag is sold for railroad ballast and for sand blasting grit. A third product of the smelting process is sulphur dioxide, a gas which is collected, purified and made into sulphuric acid for sale or for use in hydrometallurgical leaching operations. 9. Following smelting, the copper matte is fed into a converter. During this process the copper matte is poured into a horizontal cylindrical vessel (approximately 104 m) fitted with a row of pipes. The pipes, known as tuyres, project into  1. Ore is mined and crushed into a fine powder. 2. The powder is mixed with water and chemicals and fed into a leaching tank. 3. impurities drop out of the solution, and the solution is purified in two or more stages by adding zinc dust. 4. The solution is purified as the dust forces deleterious elements to precipitate so that they can be filtered out. 5. Purification is usually conducted in large agitation tanks. 6. The process takes place at temperatures ranging from 40 to 85C and pressures ranging from atmospheric to 2.4 atmospheres. 7. The elements recovered during purification include copper as a cake and cadmium as a metal. 8. After purification, the solution is ready for the final step, electrowinning. 9. Zinc electrowinning takes place in an electrolytic cell and involves running an electric current from a lead-silver alloy anode through the aqueous zinc solution. 10. This process charges the suspended zinc and forces it to deposit onto an aluminium cathode which is immersed in the solution. 11. Every 24 to 48 hours, each cell is shut down, the zinc-coated cathodes removed and rinsed, and the zinc mechanically stripped from the aluminium plates. 12. The zinc concentrate is then melted and cast into ingots and is often as high as 99.995% pure.  1. Copper matte is placed in a converter. 2. Lime and silica are added to the converter. 3. The furnace is rotated so that the tuyres are submerged. 4. Air is blown into the molten matte, causing the iron sulphide to react with oxygen and form iron oxide and sulphur dioxide. 5. The converter is rotated to pour off the iron silicate slag. 6. The converter is rotated back and given a second blow of air, during which the sulphur is oxidized and removed from the copper sulphide. 7. The converter is then rotated to pour off the molten copper, which at this point is called blister copper. 8. Sulphur dioxide from the converters is collected and fed into the gas purification system together with that from the smelting furnace and made into sulphuric acid. 9. Blister copper, containing a minimum of 98.5% copper, is refined to high purity copper in two steps. 10. The first step is fire refining, in which the molten blister copper is poured into a cylindrical furnace, similar in appearance to a converter, where first air and then natural gas or propane are blown through the melt to remove the last of the sulphur and any residual oxygen from the copper. 11. The molten copper is then poured into a casting wheel to form anodes pure enough for electrorefining. 12. In electrorefining, the copper anodes are loaded into electrolytic cells and interspaced with copper starting sheets, or cathodes, in a bath of copper sulphate solution. 13. When a direct current is passed through the cell, the copper is dissolved from the anode, transported through the electrolyte, and re-deposited on the cathode starting sheets. 14. When the cathodes have built-up to sufficient thickness, they are removed from the electrolytic cell and a new set of starting sheets is put in their place. 15. Solid impurities in the
