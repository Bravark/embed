Write a concise summary of the following:

the concentrates are dried and fed into one of several different types of furnaces. There the sulphide NEW PAGE minerals are partially oxidized and melted to yield a layer of matte, a mixed copper-iron sulphide and slag, an upper layer of waste. The matte is further processed by converting. The slag is tapped from the furnace and stored or discarded in slag piles onsite. A small amount of slag is sold for railroad ballast and for sand blasting grit. A third product of the smelting process is sulphur dioxide, a gas which is collected, purified and made into sulphuric acid for sale or for use in hydrometallurgical leaching operations. Following smelting, the copper matte is fed into a converter. During this process the copper matte is poured into a horizontal cylindrical vessel (approximately 104 m) fitted with a row of pipes. The pipes, known as tuyres, project into  The extraction of copper involves a number of steps, including smelting, fire refining, and electrorefining. Smelting is the first step in the process, and involves heating the copper ore in a furnace to remove impurities. The resulting copper matte is then treated with lime and silica to remove iron oxide, and any scrap copper is also added to the converter. The furnace is rotated so that the tuyres are submerged, and air is blown into the molten matte, causing the remainder of the iron sulphide to react with oxygen to form iron oxide and sulphur dioxide. The converter is then rotated to pour off the iron silicate slag. Once all of the iron is removed, the converter is rotated back and given a second blow of air during which the remainder of the sulphur is oxidized and removed from the copper sulphide. The converter is then rotated to pour off the molten copper, which at this point is called blister copper (so named because if allowed to solidify at this point, it will have a bumpy surface due to the presence of gaseous oxygen and sulphur). Sulphur dioxide from the converters is collected and fed into the gas purification system together with that from the smelting furnace and made into sulphuric acid. Due to its residual copper content, slag is recycled back to the smelting furnace. Blister copper, containing a minimum of 98.5% copper, is refined to high purity copper in two steps. The first step is fire refining, in which the molten blister copper is poured into a cylindrical furnace, similar in appearance to a converter, where first air and then natural gas or propane are blown through the melt to remove the last of the sulphur and any residual oxygen from the copper.

The process of extracting copper from ore is known as smelting. Copper is typically extracted from oxide and sulfide ores that contain between 0.5 and 2.0 percent copper. The first step in the smelting process is to concentrate the ore, which typically contains between 0.5 and 2.0 percent copper, into a material with a much higher concentration of copper. The concentrated ore is then heated in a furnace to a temperature that is high enough to melt the copper, but low enough to avoid vaporizing the sulfur impurities. The molten copper is then poured into a horizontal cylindrical vessel (approximately 104 m) fitted with a row of pipes. The pipes, known as tuyres, project into the furnace and are used to blow air into the molten matte, causing the remainder of the iron sulphide to react with oxygen to form iron oxide and sulphur dioxide. The converter is then rotated to pour off the iron silicate slag. Once all of the iron is removed, the converter is rotated back and given a second blow of air during which the remainder of the sulphur is oxidized and removed from the copper sulphide.
